# DEPLOYED_STATE.md — Canonical deployment identity & state triage

**Date:** 2026-10-07
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for repository identity, deployed SHA, and verified state.
Per Team C recommendation: "Add a DEPLOYED_STATE.md triage record."

---

## Repository Identity

| Aspect | Value | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Local repo name** | `owoworks` | Directory name |
| **Git remote (origin)** | `https://github.com/erpforgeafrica-dotcom/OwoWorks.git` | **Canonical remote** |
| **Brand name** | `Promota` | Product brand |
| **GitHub repo (deployed)** | `erpforgeafrica-dotcom/OwoWorks` | Pushed as `OwoWorks` |
| **Branch** | `main` | Default |

**Note:** The repository was created as `OwoWorks` (prior brand). The product is rebranded to `Promota`. The GitHub remote remains `OwoWorks` for continuity. All code, docs, and deployment artifacts reference `Promota` as the product brand.

## Critical Blockers (Owner Action Required)

| # | Blocker | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Trademark + CAC + domain for "Promota" | UNVERIFIED | Web prior-art done; legal clearance needed |
| 2 | Registered entity + PII-storage decision | UNVERIFIED | Jurisdiction, data residency |
| 3 | Termii API key (SMS OTP worker) | MISSING | Blocks `verified_at` flow |
| 4 | Payment gateway (cash payouts) | NOT STARTED | Flutterwave/Paystack/Monnify |
| 5 | KYC/IDV provider | NOT STARTED | Smile Identity/VerifyMe/Youverify |
| 6 | Data aggregator (MTN/Glo/Airtel) | NOT STARTED | Termii/Migo/Arkesel |
| 7 | Legal counsel (NDPA + SEC) | NOT STARTED | Compliance review |

## Release Gates (Team C — Updated Post-Team D)

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **G-001: RLS Verification** | ✅ CLOSED | 14/0/0 on staging (2026-10-05) |
| **G-002: Product Scope Agreement** | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Docs aligned; scope = lead-capture pilot |
| **G-003: Integration Tests** | ✅ CLOSED (replaced) | `db/leads.test.mjs` 41 tests on PGlite |
| **G-003′: Client Fetch Path** | ⚠️ OPEN | No DOM/fetch-level test for `submit_lead` |
| **G-004: CI Configuration** | ✅ CLOSED | `.github/workflows/test.yml` created |
| **GH-1: Oracle Fix** | ✅ CLOSED | `0007` applied + live verified on staging |

---

## Next Recommended Actions (Priority Order)

### Immediate (This Week) — No External Deps
1. Add DOM/fetch-level integration test for `submit_lead` (closes G-003′)
2. Add structured logging + `/metrics` endpoint (observability)
3. Document canonical repository identity in README

### Short Term (2-4 Weeks) — No External Deps
4. Build Admin Dashboard API + minimal UI (DB ready)
5. Build Promoter Dashboard (task assignment, payout history, dispute view)
6. Build Partner Portal (partner role + permissions exist)
7. Add observability stack (Grafana Cloud free tier)

### Medium Term (1-2 Months) — Requires External Deps
8. Termii API key + SMS worker → `verified_at` flow
9. Payment gateway integration (Flutterwave/Paystack) for cash payouts
10. KYC/IDV provider integration (Smile Identity/VerifyMe)
11. Data aggregator integration (Termii/Migo) for MTN/Glo/Airtel bundles
12. Platform OAuth (YouTube/Facebook) for follower verification

### Long Term / Regulatory
13. Trademark registration (Nigeria + international)
14. CAC registration (legal entity)
15. Domain acquisition (promota.ng / promota.com)
16. NDPA compliance audit
17. SEC compliance review (anti-MLM already designed in)

## Sign-off

| Role | Name | Date | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Release Owner** | [OWNER] | TBD | PENDING |
| **Team A (Product/Business)** | Delivered | 2026-10-05 | ✅ Complete |
| **Team C (Red Team)** | Delivered | 2026-10-05 | ✅ Complete |
| **Team D (Verifier)** | Delivered | 2026-10-05 | ✅ Complete |

**Current Verdict:** CONDITIONAL GO for lead-capture-only pilot.
Full marketplace remains NO-GO pending external dependencies and admin/promoter/business UIs.
